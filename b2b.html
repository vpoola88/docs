			<p class="lead">Setting up a B2b Site will vary across each project. The following steps are an overall scope of how to help development with B2B projects and are to help provide a stepwise developmental process.</p>

			<h2>1. SiteMap Layout</h2>
			<p>Development time is expedited when an overall sitemap is provided to better understand the responsabilities of each page. Provide a sitemap with reference to the following link. Creating one in powerpoint or using a word document is helfpul. <a href="http://handbook.imarc.net/strategy#SiteMap" target="_blank">SiteMap Reference</a></p>

			<h2>2. Google Docs Content Layout</h2>
			<p>After a sitemap is created, the next step would be to divy content into google docs for the developers. Create a singel google doc per page, and place in any content for the team to copy over. If content is not available, use placeholder content so the developers can continue with page layouts.</p>

			<h2>3. Image Asset Creation</h2>
			<p>Simultaneous to content layout, it is crucial that assets are cut and provided for the first phase of development. To do so,</p>
				<ul>
					<li>1. Get all assets from design.</li>
					<li>2. In photobucket, create an album for the project</li>
					<li>3. Create sub-albums for images that will go on each page</li>
					<li>4. Provide development with the photobucket links that will go into the google docs for where content is placed</li>
				</ul>
